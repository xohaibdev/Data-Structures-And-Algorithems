Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository is a collection of my implementations of various data structures and algorithms in different programming languages. The code is organized for easy reference and exploration, providing a valuable resource for learning and practicing fundamental concepts in computer science.

Structure
The repository is structured into folders based on different categories, such as:

Data Structures: Contains implementations of essential data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

Algorithms: Includes a variety of algorithmic solutions, ranging from sorting and searching algorithms to dynamic programming and graph algorithms.

Language-Specific: Organized folders for specific programming languages, allowing for easy navigation and comparison of implementations across languages.

Usage
Feel free to explore the code, use it for educational purposes, or contribute by adding your own implementations. Each code file is accompanied by comments explaining the logic and functionality, making it accessible for learners and developers at different levels.

Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to this collection or improve existing implementations, please follow the contribution guidelines in the repository. Your input is highly valued, and together we can create a comprehensive resource for the programming community.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
